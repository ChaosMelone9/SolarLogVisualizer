# SolarLogVisualizer
Hello Everyone!
Thank you vor visiting my small little project.
This project is my second attempt in designing a usable UI for my own [SolarLogAPI](https://github.com/ChaosMelone9/SolarLogAPI) and for semi-daily usage.

Please do note that I heavily recommend to use InfluxDB in combination with Grafana as it is more powerfull and bugfree than this might ever be.

If you would like to help or add anything you would find necessary feel free to open a pull request or contact me. You can also suggest features if you'd like.

Please do note that I'm only part time developing, so I might prioritize other projects more likely.

### Setup
If you haven't installed the SolarLogAPI into your local maven repository please run the `addAPI.sh` file and refresh maven.
